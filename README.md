#### Architecture:
Covid Tracker follow the MVC's model and it is based on Flask.
In the home directory it has the following files:

* .gitignore: Contain files not shared in git.
* app.py: it is the app's controller. It contain route, configuration and the back end's logic.

* LICENSE: Include terms of GNU GPL 3.0 license.
* Pipfile and Pipfile.lock: Those two file contains information for virtual enviroment.
* README.md: It is the documentation file.
* requirements.txt: It contains all dependences for Flask.

In the /static directory are stored all static files:
* /static/css/styles.css: This file is the app stylesheet

#### Design:
For back end, the idea is to create a secure, mainteinable and scalable application. This is why controller is devided in more thematic file (even if the app is small). About security we rely on some Flask library to manage and process users input and on built-in feature on Flask and Jinja. In the database users password are encrypted.
For back end the app is built with the following technologies: 

* Python.
* Flask - web framework.
* SQLite - database.
* Jinja2 - template. 
* Flask WTF form - Form handler / Form validation.
* flask-sqlalchemy - ORM.
* Flask-Session - manage session.
* requests - manage http requests.
* requests_cache - cache requests for 10 minutes.

For front end, the idea is a responsive and accessible application. Font and color palette choises are based on readability and most of the app feature are about responsivness. 

For front end the app is built with the following technologies: 
* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Font Awesome Icon
